# Welcome to helm-app! 👋

At helm-app, we're focused on building developer tools for the modern tech stack that are **simple to use** and **performant where it matters**.

Our journey started with experimental game engine for 2D, leading to the creation of our flagship library:

* **[transformer.js](https://github.com/helm-app/transformer.js)**: The no-nonsense, ultra-light, and lightning-fast transformer.js library. ✨

Beyond transformer.js, we're actively exploring and working on other critical areas:

* grpc optimization
* nix-ndnpkgs integration
* Developer experience tools
* Performance monitoring

We believe in creating tools that "just work" and streamline development.
